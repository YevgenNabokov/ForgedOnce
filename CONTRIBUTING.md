## Project Priorities
See priorities in [first milestone](https://github.com/YevgenNabokov/ForgedOnce/milestone/1)
## Pull Request Process
Haven't set it in stone yet, but initially it will look like this:
* Change is discussed with project author prior to implementation
* Change is implemented in development branch
  * All tests are passing
  * Guidelines for new code test coverage and styling will be added later
* Pull request is created
  * If you have multiple small commits, squash them where it makes sense
  * Make it possible to fast-forward merge your branch
  * Provide comments in pull request that might simplify the review process
* Pull request is reviewed by project author
* When all remarks (if any) are corrected by contributor change is merged into master by project author
